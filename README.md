# CSE231-Project-3
This script calculates properties of triangles from user-entered side lengths. It identifies if a shape is a valid triangle and determines its type (isosceles, scalene, equilateral, right, oblique, obtuse). It also computes angles, perimeter, and area. Useful for understanding geometric principles and conditional statements in Python.
