# CSE231-Project-3
This Python script determines if a given set of sides forms a valid triangle and calculates its properties. It checks for triangle types (isosceles, scalene, equilateral, right, oblique, obtuse) and computes angles, perimeter, semi-perimeter, and area. Users input side lengths, and the script outputs the triangle's details and the total number of valid triangles processed. Ideal for learning geometric calculations and conditional logic in Python.
